# Servers: which VPS does what

Checked on the machines themselves on 2026-11-04 (read-only: service lists, Caddyfile, directory names). SSH aliases are in
`~/.ssh/config` (`vps1`, `vps2`, `vps3`, user `root`, key files per host). No keys, tokens or passwords belong in this file.

| Alias | Address | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `vps1` | 147.189.174.63 | Not recorded anywhere in the repo. Fill in. |
| `vps2` | 195.62.47.178 | Static files over Caddy: mods and skins. |
| `vps3` | 194.156.90.219 | Game servers (Rust `lr_server` and the Godot live server) and the update downloads. |

## VPS 3: game servers and updates

- `lastroute-rust.service`: the Rust port's `lr_server` (HTTP API on port 8105, UDP gameplay relay on port 1105).
  Binary: `/opt/lastroute-rust/current/lr_server` (the previous one is kept in `/opt/lastroute-rust/previous`).
  Data: `/var/lib/lastroute-rust/` (`saves`, `crash-reports`, `updates`, `update-manifest.json`, `moderation.json`,
  `reserved_rooms.json`, `guest_names.json`). Secrets: `/etc/lastroute-rust/lastroute-rust.env` (root only, never printed or committed).
- `last-route.service`: "LastRoute Live Server", the Godot version's server, still running beside it.
- Updates: the game's updater downloads builds from `/var/lib/lastroute-rust/updates`, described by `update-manifest.json`.
  CI publishes with `packaging/publish-vps.sh` (upload user `nightly-upload`), and local builds publish with
  `packaging/local/publish-local.sh publish` (host `vps3` by default).
- Deploying `lr_server`: stop the service, replace `/opt/lastroute-rust/current/lr_server`, check the SHA-256, start it. See TODO.md.

## VPS 2: mods and skins (static files)

Caddy (`caddy.service`) serves two sites from `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`:

- `mods.kyttuslab.org` serves `/srv/lr3d/mods` (cache one hour). Layout `<pack_id>/<version>/pack.json` plus files, and an
  `index.json` at the root written by `tools/mods/publish-index.mjs` (copy it over by hand after review).
  The server reads the public URL from `LASTROUTE_MODS_BASE` (see docs/MODDING_SPEC.md section 4.7).
- `skins.kyttuslab.org` serves `/srv/skins` (cache one year, `immutable`, CORS `*`, `nosniff`). Because of `immutable`, a skin file
  must never be replaced under the same name: publish a new name (a content hash).
  On 2026-11-04 the folder was empty. Nothing uploads there: `lr_server` stores uploaded skins itself
  (`<data dir>/skins/<hash>.png`, `GET /api/v1/skins/<hash>`), and the game asks `lr_server` first, then this host over https
  (`https://skins.kyttuslab.org/<hash>.png`, a copy someone puts there by hand), then the legacy `/api/skins/files/<hash>.png`
  route. Every answer is checked by the full shared skin check before it is used, so a wrong or hostile file in this folder
  cannot hurt a player. See docs/SKIN_SYNC.md.

Other things on VPS 2 (not part of this project's docs): `/srv/osm`, `/opt/lastroute-host`, `/opt/node`.

## Open

- What `vps1` is for.
- Whether `lr_server` should sit behind Caddy, and the account forwarding variable `LASTROUTE_ACCOUNT_UPSTREAM` (TODO.md).
